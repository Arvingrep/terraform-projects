## Terraform Projects. 

The following Github repository stores all my Terraform projects. 

Project [Setting up EKS with Terraform, Helm and a Load balancer](https://github.com/Skanyi/terraform-projects/tree/main/eks)


### Add monitoring to the EKS Cluster

1. Monitoring using prometheus and grafana

If there is any tooling or project that you would like to see integrated with EKS cluster, create an issue and if I have time i will add it to the project.
